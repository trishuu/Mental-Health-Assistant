Common types of mood disorders include major depressive disorder (depression), bipolar disorder, and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). These disorders involve disturbances in mood regulation, ranging from persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness (depression) to alternating periods of depression and mania or hypomania (bipolar disorder). Mood disorders can have a profound impact on emotional, cognitive, and physical well-being."

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP), is considered the first-line treatment for OCD. ERP involves gradually exposing individuals to feared situations or stimuli while preventing the performance of compulsive rituals, allowing them to learn healthier ways of responding to obsessions. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants may also be prescribed to help reduce symptoms of OCD. Supportive interventions, self-help strategies, and lifestyle modifications can complement treatment and improve overall well-being."

Obsessions are intrusive, unwanted thoughts, images, or urges that repeatedly occur and cause anxiety or distress. Common obsessions include fears of contamination, doubts about safety or harm, and concerns about order or symmetry. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to obsessions, often in an attempt to neutralize or alleviate anxiety. Compulsions may include rituals such as excessive cleaning, checking, counting, or arranging objects. Individuals with OCD may also experience avoidance behaviors, perfectionism, and difficulties with decision-making or flexibility."

Depression is also frequently seen alongside OCD, with symptoms of low mood, loss of interest, and feelings of hopelessness. Additionally, OCD may co-occur with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, as well as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Substance use disorders, particularly those involving alcohol or drugs, may also occur concurrently with OCD.
